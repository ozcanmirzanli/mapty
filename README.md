# Mapty Workout Tracker

This Workout Tracker is a web application developed from a tutorial in Jonas Schmedtmann's JavaScript course on Udemy. It's designed for athletes who wish to log their running and cycling workouts effortlessly. Leveraging modern web technologies, this app facilitates workout logging, mapping your workout locations, and dynamically updating your workout list. Whether you are a runner tracking pace and distance or a cyclist monitoring speed and elevation gain, this app provides a streamlined platform to record every workout detail.

## Features

- **Track Different Workout Types**: Log running or cycling workouts easily.
- **Geolocation Support**: Automatically captures your workout location.
- **Dynamic Workout Logs**: Workouts are displayed on a map and in a list.
- **Interactive Map**: Uses the Leaflet library for map display and interaction.
- **Performance Insights**: Calculates pace for running and speed for cycling, among other metrics.

## How to Use

1. **Start a Workout**: Select running or cycling, and enter the distance, duration, and either cadence (for running) or elevation gain (for cycling).
2. **Log Your Location**: The app automatically captures and marks your location when starting a workout.
3. **Review Your Workouts**: Workouts are dynamically added to both the map and a list for easy review.
4. **Interact with Workouts**: Click on a workout in the list to focus on its location on the map.
